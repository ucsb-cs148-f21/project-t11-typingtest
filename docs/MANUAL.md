# How to use our current website
The current website is structured to allow students to learn and improve their typing skills. It can also be used
by adults trying to learn or gain some experience with code.

In the future we have an additional navigation panel that links to statistics global and user specific.
Currently there is only three tabs, Home, Language, Practice. 
The Home page lists the information about the app, who is intended for its use, and how it can be  used.
The Language page lists languages, C++, Python, and Java. Clicking on these languages takes you to a practice page for each language.

# Practice Page
Each practice page contains a WPM counter, a progress bar, and a description of what the code does. It also contains a word count and at the end highlights
the code that you have typed incorrectly.

# Profile Page
The profile page is essential to our app. It allows the user to see the problem completed, number of incorrect problems, and a variety of 
problems that the user should focus on. It also shows global user statistics and specific user statsitics like average WPM over all coding problems,
trend in progress of WPM and accuracy, etc.
