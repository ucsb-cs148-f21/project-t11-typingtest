# How to navigate our website

# Intended User Audience
The current website is structured to allow users to learn to code in a top-down method of learning. This method focuses on repitition & develops pattern recognition through typing many coding problems.

# Navigation

In the future we intend to add an additional navigation panel that links to global and user-specific statistics.
Currently there are three tabs: Home, Language, and Profile. 
The Home page lists the information about the app, who is intended for its use, and how it can be used.
The Language page lists the available languages. Clicking on these languages takes you to a respective code problem list.
The Profile page only displays when signed in.

# Problem Page
Each problem page contains a WPM counter, a progress bar, and a timer. It also highlights
the code that you have typed incorrectly.

# Profile Page
The profile page allows the user to see the percentage of problems completed. In the future it will show statistics such as average WPM, WPM over time, accuracy, etc.
