# How to navigate our website

# Intended User Audience
The current website is structured to allow users to learn to code in a top-down method of learning. This means that they learn through repitition & pattern recognition from typing many coding problems.

# Navigation

In the future we have an additional navigation panel that links to statistics global and user specific.
Currently there is only three tabs, Home, Language, Profile. 
The Home page lists the information about the app, who is intended for its use, and how it can be used.
The Language page lists languages, C++, Python, and Java. Clicking on these languages takes you to a code problem list page for each language.
The Profile page only shows when signed in.

# Problem Page
Each problem page contains a WPM counter, a progress bar, and a timer. It also highlights
the code that you have typed incorrectly.

# Sign In
Signing in allows you to save your problems, the problems that you submit get stored and saved to the database. The global user statistic are also stored here.

# Profile Page
The profile page is essential to our app. It allows the user to see the percentage of problems completed, and a variety of 
problems that the user should focus on. It will also show global user statistics and specific user statsitics like average WPM over all coding problems,
trend in progress of WPM and accuracy in the future, etc.
