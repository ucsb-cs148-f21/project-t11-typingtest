My name is Sean, and I'm a computer science major.
I've got a bit of programming experience, but I have not ever made a project with this kind of scale before. I tend to sweat the details, but I also have the resolve to figure out nagging issues.

For this project, I was thinking it could be interesting if the answers someone typed into the problem side of the coding test could generate new lines of code to practice typing. Being able to practice typing out arbitrary lines of code could be cool, but as is the project seems to be leaning more towards giving problems for coders to solve. Being able to track those kinds of metrics alongside the usual speed and accuracy would help this app stand out, but besides that I am not really sure what direction I would want to help pilot the program.
