1. The button test is in project-t11-typingtest/src/utils/button/, it uses React Testing Library and it tests if a button successfully renders on the home page.
2. We may implement more unit tests in the future, but it may also be more convienent to just test our product locally as it doesn't require the trouble of learning and implementing the testing libraries
3. For this lab we tested our NavBar.js in project-t11-typingtest/src/components/Navbar.test.js
4. For higher-level tests going forward, will probably again just try testing the components locally, but if there requires a test for something that cannot be easily displayed then, we may consider implementing more higher-level tests.
