There is more optimism in the project than last time. 

Writing out coding problems to figure out is interesting (alongside the ELO concept), but also a major undertaking. Focusing on just getting information from typing would be a better start.

A feasible MVP would be taking code snippets and then tracking a basic metric as one types. Note that the todo list section has lots of code that could be copied.

React seems to be the most versatile framework; Vue was considered briefly but dropped due to not being as versatile. Opinions on backends are vague but gravitate towards Python backends.

Everyone has Heroku accounts and will work together on a single Hello World program.

Note: heroku app's name should start with team name + person who deployed it. For organization
