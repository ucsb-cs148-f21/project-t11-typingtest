Part One: “What will we do?”
We came up with a list of issues and stories that we had to deal with. Chief of them being a simple web interface up and running.
List of User Stories and Issues:
(1) As a user I want a basic web interface so I can use the typingtest app.
(2) As a user I want categories of coding problems so that I can train specific skills.
(3) As a user I want a clock or numerical countdown to see how much time I have left.
(4) As a user I want to measure how accurately I type so I can set benchmarks for how much I can improve.
(5) As a user I want to measure how fast I can type so I can measure my typing skills.
(6) As a user I want to use Google Authenticate so users can save their progress and be verified.
(7) As a user I want to choose the programming language I want to practice.


Part 2: “How will we do it?”
We start off with the first two issues. Zoey, Hirish and Jeffrey are planning on getting the basic webapp running whereas Sean and Jason are compiling code blocks for
specific coding problems so the user can choose which category of code they want to get better with. After this Zoey, Hirish and Jeffrey will utilize prexisting code 
to create the logic for the app, tacking issues 4-7 with the help of Sean and Jason.
