* Led by: Hirish
* Present: Jeffrey, Sean, Zoey, Jason, Hirish

## Action item

* a goal: 
(1)working on at least for java getting the practice page for each code snippet (hirish/zoey)
(2)add more code snippets (sean)
(3)c++, python (hirish/zoey)
(4)google authentication-store information about profiles (jason)
* a change: fixing the practice page typing component (jeffrey)
* a measurement: By friday before we share our project with the other groups the goals should be close to complete or done.
## Retro Outcome Assessment

* Our retrospective experiment tested our team's ability to work well on managing several tasks and assigning work to all of our team members. Our retrospective experiment's specific requirements were to visually change our clock, profile page, and our UI/pages. We have added a styles.css that changes the look of the UI and we have implemented a cleaner timer that doesn't interfere when typing. Our profile page has also changed appearance due to the css update, so the experiment was a success. (These changes are on the implemTypCom branch)

## Possible Improvement
* We should spend more time on checking if our labs are done. 
* Update our kanban board more often so we can know what everyone is working on.
* Think about more functionalities and prioritize the most feasible one. 
* Communicate more about the difficulties we are facing
* Study more about the fundamentals of how React and JavaScript work

## Retro Assessment

* I utilized the start stop continue method.
* There was good participation from all the team members it went well.
* I think the team is more focused now and willing to work on the projects now. They tasks have been clearly delineated and people know what they have to start.
