## General Notes

* Record anything else you think the team might want to remember from this retro|
doing alright, haven't accomplished much yet|
our goal is currently to figure out a tech stack, but we have that down|
probably need to check out frameworks more but we have enough time|
Jason figured out src hierarchy|
finish basic web app interface today probably|
Issue: Hirish couldnt start authentication on CSIL|
basic starting point, following the videos|

possible backend goals: a timer and google API

possible frontend goals: a basic textbox, and a title, sign in as well(update: we finished the Google authentification)

virtual keyboard? as a luxury idea


## Retro Assessment

The 4 L's structure was loosely used in this retrospective. Later on we also tried to discuss in terms of start, stop, continue

The measurement went well, as we deployed our app onto heroku.

If I had to give advice to the next leader, I would suggest to try and come into the retrospective with a more clear idea of how your structure could apply to discussing how the product is going. Sometimes the group can break into chunks and just discuss whatever is on their mind, which is fine, but if you really need to focus on a specific topic, then having a more calculated retrospective could help. Encouraging the team to consider the goal, change, and measurement rather than working on that after the fact would be helpful as well.

We also finished the starter code deployment. We got it pushed to main. This was a successful retro.
