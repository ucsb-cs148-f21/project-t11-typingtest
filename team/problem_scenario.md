Personas
===========

Persona1
-----------
A is a freshman of CS major. A wants a place just to practise coding typing with actually compiling the code and for traditional methods you have to actually compile the code in order to know the typos without an IDE, so that A can get familiar with the syntaxs of some functions in a certain language. 

Persona2
-----------
B has some coding experience with C++ and want to learn a new language Python. B wants a web for typing in Python would to get familiar with the code snippets of python as quick as possible.

Persona3
----------
C is an administrator. C wants to supply snippets of code so that users have a variety of prompts to type out.

Persona4
-----------
D is a programmer and D want to get a metric for how fast or accurate D can type.

Persona5
-----------
E is a CS student who needs to prepare for the exams. E wants a place for both typing and problem solving for coding problems.

Goals
=========
We will create a typing tutor/trainer for programmers based on open source code, allow you to practice typing the key sequences that appear in real code in different languages. Typing read code can help with the speed and accracy of coding as well as remembering the syntax. Faster and more accurate typing not only does this speed up development, it fundamentally affects the exploration process.
