# Retro #2 10/29/21 

* Led by: Jeffrey
* Present: Jeffrey, Sean, Zoey, Jason 
* Present Via Zoom: Hirish

## Action item

* a goal: We want to accelerate our work and get features out faster
* a change: Work on easier features like the UI and pages first, add information to the profile pages on what they have done so far, make the timer cleaner
* a measurement: We want these working features accomplished by Friday next week (must have new page that redirects to other languages, must have relevant information in profile to user, must have timer that isn't intrusive) 

## Retro Outcome Assessment

* Our retrospective experiment tested our team's ability to work well on managing several tasks and assigning work to all of our team members. Our retrospective experiment's specific requirements were to visually change our clock, profile page, and our UI/pages. We have added a styles.css that changes the look of the UI and we have implemented a cleaner timer that doesn't interfere when typing. Our profile page has also changed appearance due to the css update, so the experiment was a success. (These changes are on the implemTypCom branch)
