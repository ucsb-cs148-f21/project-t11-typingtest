Agreements:
1. When one of us is absent for an unavoidable reason, we will let the other team members know on the team slack channel, in advance when possible, as soon as possible afterwards when not.
2. We will each try to keep such absences to a minimum.
3. Those of us that are present will do our best to share with the absent team member(s) what they missed and help them get back up to speed.
4. We will all do our best to contribute to the teams success.
5. We will use pull requests for major changes and ask another member of our team to check our work before merging into main.
