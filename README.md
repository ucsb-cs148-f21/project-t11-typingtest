# project-t11-typingtest

It's a webapp that helps improve coding speed and gauge coding level. We will include a clock and accuracy in our API. The user can choose the language and difficulty of the coding problems and we want to expand it into a more code learning web by adding some questions so users can think about while they are coding to improve the coding skills.

Tech Stack:
=======
Frontend: React
Backend: MongoDB, Flask

How to Deploy:
=======
Due to google sign-in requirements, it is no longer possible to deploy our project locally. 

For detailed instructions go to [a relative link](DEPLOY.md)

Project final release: https://code-per-minute.herokuapp.com/


General Strategy: 
=======
Get our template up, look at preexisting react projects, modify accordingly. There is nothing wrong with modifying previously implemented code, it will give us more time to add more features down the line.


User Roles:
========
General User Trying to Learn How to Code, and remember syntax. Doesn't need permission to any data except his/her own. Can log in through his/her ucsb account and save progress. Our app provides typing practice for difficult lines of code and helps with syntax memorization and also explains what code blocks do so helps with pattern recognition.

User Roles:
========
One unit test was already implemented, to see it look at project-t11-typingtest/src/utils/button/.
